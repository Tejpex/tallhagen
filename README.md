# Tallhagen scout

This is a site displaying information about the upcoming camp for a scoutgroup in Kalmar. The visitors can read about the camp and sign up.

It is made using React Vite because I wanted to practise using React. In the future I might set up more component and use routes to display different types of information on different pages.
